Matrix Demos here do not actually use Adafruit::GFX's primitives, but may use
NeoMatrix's X/Y mapping function and then address the led array directly.
This code is therefore only compatible with a FastLED backend.
I've included it because I found some cool demos that I adapted to run
with my hardware.
