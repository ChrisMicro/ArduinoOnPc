Aurora Demos ported to FastLED::NeoMatrix
=========================================

Aurora Pattern Demos were ported to FastLED::NeoMatrix by Marc MERLIN

Aurora.ino is the main code you can compile and that will run my favourite patterns.
You can send 'n', 'p' via serial console or '10' to switch to pattern #10

You can also go in a subdirectory like Aurora/bounce to only compile/run the bounce pattern.

* In _baddisplay, you will find code that I believe is broken, potentially by me. If you can fix it, send patches.
* In _notmytaste, you will fine code that works fine but that I don't like as much.

Enjoy.
